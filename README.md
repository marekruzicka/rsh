remote shell -  script for remote administration of netapp filers

Over the years it evolved from simple 'ssh filer cmd' to kind of wrapper around numerous scripts.
It requires rather complex environment ot work properly...
* automounter
* syslog server
* bash completion
* several external scripts (developed mostly by Kamil Madac)
* etc
